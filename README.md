# TradePrices
This repo updates (daily) a `./static/data.csv` file with the average prices of globally accepted trades obtained via the [Politics and War data dumps](https://politicsandwar.com/data). The contents of `./static/data.csv` is not sorted by any means and may contain gaps of missing days due to the non-existence of that corrosponding data dump.

The exact CSV format used follows [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180).
